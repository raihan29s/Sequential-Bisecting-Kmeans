# Sequential-Bisecting-Kmeans
An implementation of Sequential Bisecting Kmeans using C
In order to Run a C code, we need to have a gcc compiler in our Mac System.
To install gcc compiler on Mac OS X, we need to download and install “Command Line Tools for Xcode”, which is available in Apple’s developer page. After the installation of Xcode, we can compile and run the C program as follows:

1.	To compile the sequential code run the command “gcc BisectingKmeans.c -o try -lm” on Terminal
2.	Then Run the command ./try
